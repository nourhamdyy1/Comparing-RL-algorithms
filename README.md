This project implements and compares three Reinforcement Learning (RL) 
algorithms—Monte Carlo, Q-Learning, and SARSA—on the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym.
The CartPole environment is discretized into bins to handle continuous state spaces. 
The code trains agents using each algorithm and evaluates their performance by calculating the average reward over multiple episodes.
Finally, a bar plot compares the average rewards of the three algorithms.
